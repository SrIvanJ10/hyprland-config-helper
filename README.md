# hyprland-config-helper
TUI configuration manager for Hyprland using dialog

## üìñ About

This is a personal learning project where I'm attempting to create a text-based interface to manage Hyprland configuration without manually editing config files.

It will start with simple features like keybindings management, and the goal is to eventually handle the entire Hyprland config. The aim is to help both current Hyprland users who want a simpler way to configure their setup, and newcomers who find manual config editing intimidating.

Built with bash and dialog to keep it simple and lightweight.

## üìã Requirements

- Hyprland
- `dialog` (or `whiptail` as fallback)
- `bash` 4.0+

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

- [x] Project structure
- [ ] Config parser
- [ ] Main menu UI
- [ ] Keybindings editor
- [ ] Animations configurator
- [ ] Workspace manager
- [ ] Backup system
- [ ] Input validation

## About This Project

Hi! üëã I'm Iv√°n ([@SrIvanJ10](https://github.com/SrIvanJ10)), I'm from Seville, Spain, and I'm currently studying Software Engineering.

I'm learning as I go, so:
- **Development pace:** Irregular - some months a lot, others nothing. That's life!
- **English:** Not my native language and I'm not very good at it, so if you see typos or weird phrases, feel free to let me know (or open a pull request!)
- **Bugs:** They exist, and I appreciate any reports or fixes
- **Ideas:** Always welcome! Open an issue if you have suggestions

This is a personal learning project that I hope helps others too. Don't expect perfection, but do expect genuine effort to make it useful! üòä
